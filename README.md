# 📄✏ Forest Cover Type Prediction
**Problem Statement:** 
Forest land is highly required for developing ecosystem management. Any changes that 
occur in ecosystem should be carefully noticed to avoid further loss. This model is 
helpful in noticing the changes occurred due to heavy floods or any other calamities 
which affected the forest land. 
The goal is to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of the 
Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado with the best accuracy
 
Four wilderness areas are: 
- 1 Rawah
- 2: Neota 
- 3: Comanche Peak 
- 4: Cache la Poudre 
 
Seven categories numbered from 0 to 6 in the Cover_Type column, to be classified: 
- 0: Spruce/Fir 
- 1: Lodgepole Pine 
- 2: Ponderosa Pine 
- 3: Cottonwood/Willow 
- 4: Aspen 
- 5: Douglas-fir 
- 6: Krummholz

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, 
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine 
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case. 

Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict seven different cover 
types in four different wilderness areas of the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern 
Colorado with the best accuracy.
